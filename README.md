Groobyster: Group On Register
=============================

This Prestashop module lets you choose a custom group that each new user will be added to during sign up. 

Compatibility
-------------

Prestashop >= 1.6

Installation
------------

Download the ZIP and unpack the groobyster folder to your Prestashop /modules directory. After installing and activating the module, create a special users group and pick it on Groobyster's configuration page.


Making blocknewsletter module work with groobyster
--------------------------------------------------

The newsletter registrations made with blocknewsletter form are handled by the module's own method called registerUser() . Since we cannot hook into it from the outside and update the user's group like we do during normal user's update, we need to modify this method a bit. 

Open modules/blocknewsletter/blocknewsletter.php and replace the original registerUser() with the one provided below. Ideally, you'd like to create a copy of the original blocknewsletter module and use it in your shop because each automatic update is going to destroy the changes you've made.

    protected function registerUser($email)
    {
    	$customers = new Customer();
    	$find_customer = $customers->getByEmail( $email );
    
    	if ( !$find_customer ) {
    		return false;
    	}
    
    	$find_customer->newsletter = 1;
    	$find_customer->newsletter_date_add = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
    	$find_customer->ip_registration_newsletter = pSQL( Tools::getRemoteAddr() );
    
    	return ( $find_customer->update(true) );
    }
